Would you like to continue exploring that data? We could:\n1.  **List some of the IDs** of these floats?\n2.  **Provide summary statistics** for them?\n3.  **Focus on a specific part of the Indian Ocean**?\n4.  **Show an example of a temperature or salinity profile**?\n5.  **Visualize the locations** of these floats?\n\nOr perhaps you have a different question in mind related to the Argo float data?"
